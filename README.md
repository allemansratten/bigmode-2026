# Allemansratten Godot game template
This is a base template for a Godot game, mainly intended to speed up the initial setup during game jams or prototyping games. It contains features that are common across most games and are usually simply boilerplate that is required initially or added last minute. By using this template, we will speed up the initial setup, reduce pains of multiple contributors bootstrapping a project, and provide a predefined structure to the project.

This repo can also serve as a living knowledge-base of the experiences we have accumulated during previous game jams (we tend to forget lol). Feel free to add documents of successful or problematic areas that we encountered.

Please contribute to this template with issues or PR of features that you find yourself re-implementing accross multiple games or quality of life features that will be useful in any game project.
