# Game Design Context — Bigmode 2026

*Personal context file for the jam. Synthesized from two AI-summarized brainstorm sessions, January 29, 2026. Iterate here.*

---

## Vision (one-liner)

**3D action roguelike** — short 15–30 minute runs with combat, looting, and room-based progression. Environmental interactions, improvised weapon pickups, and build customization (items, relics, mutations). Pick-from-3 upgrades, no cards.

---

## Design pillars (lock as we go)

*Decide what’s non-negotiable for the jam; trim the rest if needed.*

- [ ] 3D, readable camera (isometric or far third-person)
- [ ] Movement: dash + at least one of teleport/swap/time control
- [ ] Improvised weapons + pick-from-3 upgrades (no cards)
- [ ] Environmental interactions (oil, water/ice, fire, electricity)
- [ ] Room-based progression with room selection
- [ ] 15–30 min runs, boss, win/lose

---

## Core Mechanics

### Movement
- **Dashes** — core mobility
- **Teleports** — positional options
- **Swaps** — e.g. swap with enemies or objects
- **Time control / bullet time** — occasional, not constant

### Combat & weapons
- **Improvised weapon pickups** — weapons found in the world, not a fixed loadout
- **Weapons scale with build** — items, relics, and mutations affect what spawns and how it behaves

---

## Progression system

- **Pick-from-3 upgrades** — classic roguelike choice (no card system)
- **Items, relics, mutations** influence:
  - Weapon spawning and behavior
  - Movement abilities (dash, teleport, swap, time)
- **Loot from chests** — relics and augments
- *Future:* optional starting weapon, meta progression

---

## Environmental features

- **Interactive surfaces:** oil slicks, water/ice, fire, electricity
- **Enemies and upgrades** react to these elements (e.g. fire on oil, shock in water)
- Design for **readability** — player should see and plan around surfaces

---

## Map & run structure

- **Room-based progression** — move from room to room
- **Handmade + semi-random** — mix of authored and randomized room layouts
- **Randomized map generation** for run variety
- **Boss encounters** and clear win/lose conditions
- *Future:* player agency in how the map is laid out

---

## Visual design

- **3D** — isometric or far third-person camera
- **Camera** — framed to show interactive surfaces and action clearly
- Keep **environmental state** (oil, fire, water, etc.) easy to read at a glance

---

## Session structure

| Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Run length** | 15–30 minutes per run |
| **Restart** | New game / full restart after each run |
| **Loop** | Combat (weapon pickup + movement) → loot collection & relic/augment from chests → **room selection** (choose next room) → repeat; boss encounters and clear win/lose at the end |
| **Future** | Meta progression, optional starting weapon selection |
